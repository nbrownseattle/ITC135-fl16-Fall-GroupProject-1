          <p><strong>What is HNM?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HNM is from our group members' first names; H from HeeTae, N from Nicole, and M from Megan.<br /><br /></p>
          
          <p><strong>HeeTae</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, this is my first web coding outside my other class! Back in university, I studied Economics and Communication, but I chose to continue my study in IT related area, such as database related study. I love playing around with computers, so I was well-known for fixing computers among people. I'm obsessed with coffee therefore love/passionate to visit different cafes in Seattle area.<br /><br /></p>
          
          <p><strong>Nicole</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm am in my third quarter studying database admin and programming at SCC. I am loving it! My background is Amazon. I worked there for fifteen years, and wore many hats. I decided I wanted to focus on programming, and decided to go back to school. Outside of school, I am a total bee nerd. I keep several hives in my backyard in West Seattle<br /><br /></p>
          
          <p><strong>Megan</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a business student taking a development class to learn more about how computer programmers think and speak. It's been very informative so far.</p>
